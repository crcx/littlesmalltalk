============================================================================

This is a continuation of the Little Smalltalk language developed by Timothy
Budd. It is based on his Version 4 source, but has been modified in many ways.
New features, classes, etc are being added and the system is slowly maturing
into a truely useful implementation of the Smalltalk language. What follows is
the original introduction.


What Little Smalltalk is, and more importantly, what it isn't

First and foremost, let me say at the beginning in as LOUD a voice as I can
that Little Smalltalk is NOT a smalltalk-80 system. If you want a real
Smalltalk system go buy one from ParcPlace, Digitalk, IBM, or whomever.

Little Smalltalk is a sort of fun experiment in building a minimal
smalltalk system. The source code for the interpreter is less than 1800
lines of code. The image consists of less than 4000 objects. It runs
in almost no memory. In short, it's small, it's reasonably fast, it's easy
to understand, and easy to modify.

As you might expect, in order to get Smalltalk to run in something this
small, I've had to make lots of changes. Here are the most notable:

 * No graphics
 * The user interface is a more conventional real-eval-print loop
   (like most Lisp systems), not a browser. (But it is all written in
   Smalltalk itself, so you can modify it if you wish).
 * Primitives and cascades are handled as they were in earlier Little
   Smalltalk systems, which is not how they are handed in Smalltalk-80.
 * The standard class hierarchy differs considerably from Smalltalk-80.
   * My basic collections are List, Tree, Dictionary, Array, and String
   * The only numbers in the standard image are large and small integers
     (adding fractions and floats might be an interesting exercise, however).
